Developed a blockchain-based solution on the Ethereum network to tokenize real assets, leveraging technologies such as Solidity, Ganache, and MetaMask for functionality implementation and ReactJS for seamless interaction with the platform. Implemented unit tests using the Mocha testing framework to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system and robust KYC process to ensure system integrity. Leveraged the Open Zeppelin smart contract as the foundation for the crowdsale smart contract, ensuring transparency in the network.
