- Refactored the existing SAS Parser Grammar to enhance communication and work efficiency.
- Improved engine efficiency to parse and generate Element Node and Terminal Node in a graph for major statements including Block, Subset, Filter Statements such as Format, label, while, abort, If-subset, etc.
- Overrode classes in the core of the ParseTree generated by ANTLR V4 to extract all variable Node, Dataset Node, Format Node from the Graph using Java Spring Boot and improved Grammar.
- Implemented multiple Fake Statements while producing the same regression result to balance the upstream and downstream of the Variable Graph.
